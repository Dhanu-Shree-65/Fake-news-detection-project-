 ðŸ“° Fake News Detection Using NLP

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify news articles as real or fake. It combines text preprocessing with TF-IDF vectorization and a Logistic Regression model for binary classification. The model is trained on a Kaggle dataset containing labeled fake and real news articles. The system is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input news text and receive instant predictions. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to combat misinformation and can be extended using deep learning. Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Streamlit.
